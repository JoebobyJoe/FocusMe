# FocusMe
 Application that helps you stay focused on your tasks

FocusMe is a Windows application that allows you to set specific times that certain apps are allowed to run.  
For example, say that you work from 9-5 and during that time you don't want to have the tempation of playing any Steam games. FocusMe allows you to prevent Steam from launching to make sure you stay focused during those hours. FocusMe allows you to set different schedules for multiple programs to ensure that you are always in your prime.
